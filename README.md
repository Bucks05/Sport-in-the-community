Sport in the Community
This site will hope to get people in the community to get out and play sport and join the Hurling and Football club Na Piarsaigh in the community, not only for playing but for the social aspect aswell for kids and adults. As there has been new housing estate in the area this will be a good benfit for people to get to meet up with new people to make friends and engage in sport. The Hurling and Football club will have days out for adults and also will have parties for young kids.

This will also have a huge benfit for the Club for the finance side and for also for the playing side on the field more numbers will help the Club compeat at underage level and bring this to senior level where the club wants to compeat and win county championships.
